# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to the project! I only have a few basic rules for pull requests:

- absolutely no use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is allowed, which includes, but is not limited to:
    - conversing with any Large Language Model (LLM) in any capacity that results in generated code
    - autocompletion (non-AI autocompletion is fine)
- if any of your code is suspected to have been generated by AI, your changes will not be accepted
- if any of your code is generated by AI, you will be permanently barred from contributing to any of my projects in the future
- if any of your code is generated by AI and you lied about it, all accepted changes will be reverted, you will be permanently barred from contributing to any of my projects in the future, and you will be publicly shamed
- do not use any code for which you do not have the rights
- do not use any code which would require an addition/change of license
- variables whose values do not change after initialization should be marked `const` (excluding handles)
- code should compile with no warnings
- match my coding style as best as you can
- for substantial contributions, split your changes into multiple, smaller commits
- no squashing/rebasing - every commit should be tracked and have a clear purpose
